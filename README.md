# Monokai pro for Obsidian

---

Monokai Pro port for Obsidian
This is my first theme, I tried to balance it between being fancy and not distracting the user

It's Based on:

- **[Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/)** colors palette
- **[Obsidian Atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom)** for the code
